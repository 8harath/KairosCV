# KairosCV - Final Application Purpose & Impact Documentation

## Executive Summary

**KairosCV** is an intelligent resume optimization platform that solves a critical problem in modern job seeking: the gap between generic resume creation and job-specific application requirements. The completed application enables job seekers to transform their existing resumes into professionally formatted, ATS-optimized, job-tailored documents in under 2 minutes—a process that would traditionally take hours of manual work.

---

## The Problem It Solves

### Job Seekers Face Three Major Challenges:

1. **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) Filter Out Qualified Candidates**
   - 75% of resumes never reach human recruiters
   - Poor formatting, missing keywords, or irrelevant content cause automatic rejection
   - Most job seekers don't understand ATS optimization requirements

2. **Generic Resumes Don't Stand Out**
   - One-size-fits-all resumes fail to highlight job-specific relevance
   - Recruiters spend 6-7 seconds per resume—generic content gets ignored
   - Tailoring resumes manually for each job is time-consuming and error-prone

3. **Resume Formatting is Time-Consuming and Technical**
   - Professional formatting requires design skills or expensive software
   - Converting between document formats often breaks formatting
   - Maintaining consistency across sections is tedious
