              We're a team of undergraduate engineers who believe the hiring process is broken. Why should career
              opportunities depend on formatting skills? Why should technical brilliance go unnoticed because someone
              doesn't know proper kerning or margin spacing?
            </p>

            <p>
              At KairosCV, we're challenging the status quo. Talent shouldn't be judged by keywords and document
              designâ€”it should be measured by knowledge, problem-solving ability, and real-world impact. We built this
              tool so that every developer, data scientist, and creative mind can showcase their abilities without
              worrying about resume templates.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether you're a coding prodigy with zero design sense or a problem-solver who never learned LaTeX,
              KairosCV levels the playing field. Because your skills deserve to be seen.
